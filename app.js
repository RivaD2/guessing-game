1. The goal of lab is to wrap each equation inside of a function
- Not defining any parameters/ arguements
- Always call the function after it has been defined
2. Clarify what encompasses a question
3. console.log at least once in each question/function
4. ACP after each question is wrapped around a function
5. Make sure that the call function is OUTSIDE the last curly braces and loops
6. Have fun!
