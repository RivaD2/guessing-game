<div class="Overview">
  <p> I have a BS in Communications and have since worked in Russia, North Carolina (where I'm from), Denver and Seattle. I worked in property management over two years and then decided it was time for life in the big city! So, I packed my bags and traveled across the country twice. I made my way here to lovely Seattle and have held roles in various industries since my arrival. I have worked as a customer support rep and lead for two different companies, as a front office coordinator in escrow and as a line cook on two of Seattle's food trucks. It's been a wild ride and I look forward to learning more as my journey continues. </p>
