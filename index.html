<p> Hi there, my name is Riva Davidowski and I am starting on a new journey into software development. Look, there's a lot to know about me, but I really only have time to tell you about my background and some of my goals for the future.

  <p> I have a BS in Communications and have since worked in Russia, North Carolina (where I'm from), Denver and Seattle. I worked in property management over two years and then decided it was time for life in the big city! So, I packed my bags and traveled across the country twice. I made my way here to lovely Seattle and have held roles in various industries since my arrival. I have worked as a customer support rep and lead for two different companies, as a front office coordinator in escrow and as a line cook on two of Seattle's food trucks. It's been a wild ride and I look forward to learning more as my journey continues.
