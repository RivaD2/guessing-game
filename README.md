**Lab: 02 - About Me, with a guessing game**

**Overview: This lab involves building out an “About Me” webpage that quizzes the user on fun facts and gives the user some basic information about who I am and where I come from**
* We refactored code each day and learned about how a web site incrementally goes from an idea to a deployed site through various iterations of development.
* This was my first exposure to user stories. 

**Featured Tasks:** 
1. Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
2. Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.
3. Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.
4. Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Added a personalized message for the user when they arrive at the site
2. Asked the user their name through a prompt()
3. Displayed that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.
4. Displayed the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.

**Below is a list of practices that I was required to follow within this lab:**

* The JS file had to contain 'use strict' declaration at the top and the javascript file had to be linked in your html file as an external script file.
* All code is cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax.
